See [`CONSUMER_PROOF.md`](./CONSUMER_PROOF.md) for the verification standard
this repo must keep before publishing.

The smoke test packs this generator, installs it beside `@topogram/cli` in
a temporary consumer project, runs `topogram check`, runs `topogram generate`,
compiles the generated app bundle, and verifies expected generated files.
